This was my attempt to produce a quiz from concepts we learned in class.
First I created an array with all of the questions and the correct answer under it.
Then I created variables and grabbed their ID's from the HTML
Next I created a function to start the quiz and produce the first question, along with the answers, and start the timer.
The timer should start at 120 seconds and count down to zero (0), any incorrect answer should subtract 10 seconds off the clock
When the user clicks on the correct answer it SHOULD move on and load the next question and answers
At the end of the quiz the user should be able to enter their initials and store their score in the local storage, and display it on a different screen
